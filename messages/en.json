Rex decided to spare this ugly white blanket that my grandmother gave me from her war days. We never threw it away because we felt bad. Seeing Rex sleep on this blanket made us happy. At least someone was using this blanket, even if we had to rebuy brand new sheets because we have such an amazing dog.",
